### Completed tasks;

1. Navigating through companies browser menu
2. Get a list of companies and count
3. Capture Company Name, address, telephone and email address of the 1st, 3rd and last company on each company browser page
4. Write to testOutput directory in json format

### Outstanding tasks;

1. company information - not all companies contain the same information which means the test currently stops at Baxter because there is no telephone, if I had more time I would write a function that takes in the label e.g. "Address", "Email" etc checks if it is available and if not returns blank, then the test could continue
2. Store logo as an image file
3. Modularise functions
4. Install prettier
5. Break test spec file to be more specific - not sure how, needs more time
